# KerasSimpsons_Tensorflow
Tutorial and stats to build a simple machine learning classifier using Tensorflow + Keras

## I am HEAVILY copying most if not all of the content from https://medium.com/@seixaslipe/building-a-simpsons-classifier-with-deep-learning-in-keras-36a47fe17f79

This is just my attempt to try this locally on my own system, and also do some benchmarks

This is based on these posts:
https://medium.com/alex-attia-blog/the-simpsons-character-recognition-using-keras-d8e1796eae36

and has code from here
